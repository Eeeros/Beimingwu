  What: {
    Title: "What is Learnware?",
    Description:
      "A learnware is a well-performed trained model with a specification describing its capabilities. The specification includes a semantic specification in text and a statistical specification sketching the model's statistical information.",

  Function: {
    Title: "What are the main functions of Beimingwu?",
    SearchAndDeploy: {
      Title: "Search and deploy learnwares: ",
      Description:
        "After the user submits the task requirements, Beimingwu will recommend learnwares that are helpful to the user's task according to the learnware specification and guide the user to deploy and reuse them.",
    },
    Submit: {
      Title: "Submit high-quality learnwares: ",
      Description:
        "Developers can spontaneously submit various learnwares to Beimingwu, and the system will check the quality of these learnwares and organize them further.",
    },
  },
  Feature: {
    Title: "What are the features of Beimingwu?",
    Recommendation: {
      Name: "Recommend more effective models with Statistical information",
      Description:
      "Beimingwu uses statistics to offer precise recommendation. If no single model fits, combining several might work. The system also supports searching and reusing misaligned feature space models for tabular tasks.",
      HomoTable: "Homogeneous table examples",
      HeteroTable: "Heterogeneous table examples",
    },
    loadAndReuse: {
      Name1: "Secure learnware loading and",
      Name2: "convenient learnware reuse",
      Description:
      "Once you acquire the learnware, there's no concern about the model's environment or security threats. It can be safely loaded with a single line of code, and the system offers various interfaces for model reuse.",
    },
    Privacy: {
      Name: "We care about your privacy",
      Description:
        "Providing task statistics helps match your needs or models more effectively. The statistical specification shares task statistics without exposing original data. This generation is local and the code is open source.",
    },
    OpenSource: {
      Name: "Beimingwu is completely open source",
      Description:
        "Beimingwu is the first fully open-source model platform, offering various deployment options. We warmly welcome the community to try and collaboratively enhance the system.",

  Why: {
    Title: "Why is a learnware dock system necessary?",
    Description:
      "There are complaints about current machine learning techniques such as the requirement of a huge amount of training data and proficient training skills, the difficulty of continual learning, the risk of catastrophic forgetting, the leaking of data privacy/proprietary, etc. The learnware dock system provides a unified solution to the aforementioned issues.",
    LackOfTrainingDataSkills: "Lack of training data/skills",
    LackOfTrainingDataSkillsDescription:
      "Strong machine learning models can be attained even for ordinary users with little training skills or limited data, because the users can acquire well-performed learnwares from the learnware dock system and further adapt or refine them, instead of starting from scratch.",
    ContinualLearning: "Continual learning",
    ContinualLearningDescription:
      "The learnware dock system naturally realizes continual and lifelong learning, because with the constant submissions of well-performed learnwares trained from diverse tasks, the knowledge held in the learnware dock system is being continually enriched.",
    CatastrophicForgetting: "Catastrophic forgetting",
    CatastrophicForgettingDescription:
      "A learnware will always be accommodated in the learnware dock system once it is accepted, unless every aspect of its function can be replaced by other learnwares. Thus, the old knowledge in the learnware dock system is always held. Nothing to be forgotten.",
    DataPrivacyProprietary: "Data privacy/proprietary",
    DataPrivacyProprietaryDescription:
      "The developers only submit their models without sharing their own data, and thus, the data privacy/proprietary can be well preserved. Although one could not deny the possibility of reverse engineering the models, the risk would be too small compared with many other privacy-preserving solutions.",
  },
  How: {
    Title: "How does the learnware dock system work?",
    Description:
      "The learnware dock system is the core entity within the learnware paradigm, which encompasses three key entities: developers, users, and the learnware dock system. The developers are usually machine learning experts who produce and want to share/sell their well-performed trained machine learning models. The users need machine learning services but usually have only limited data and lack machine learning knowledge and skills. The learnware dock system accepts well-performed trained models from developers, accommodates them in the system, and provides services to users via identifying and reusing learnwares to help users tackle their present tasks.",
  },
  SpecificationWorld: {
    Title: "Specification world",
    Description:
      "The specifications of models from different feature/label spaces constitute various specification islands, and all specification islands together constitute the specification world in the learnware dock system. In this world, if connections between different islands can be discovered and established, the corresponding specification islands can be merged.",
