    Slogan:
      "Learnware paradigm systematically reuses numerous various models to do things that may even be beyond their original purposes, and enables users to easily identify and reuse helpful models, not need to build their models from scratch.",

  What: {
    Title: "What is Learnware?",
    Description:
      "A learnware is a well-performed trained machine learning model with a specification which enables it to be adequately identified to reuse according to the requirement of future users who know nothing about the learnware in advance.",
  },
  Why: {
    Title: "Why do we need learnware?",
    Description:
      "There are complaints about current machine learning techniques such as the requirement of a huge amount of training data and proficient training skills, the difficulty of continual learning, the risk of catastrophic forgetting, the leaking of data privacy/proprietary, etc.",
    LackOfTrainingDataSkills: "Lack of training data/skills",
    LackOfTrainingDataSkillsDescription:
      "Strong machine learning models can be attained even for ordinary users with little training skills or small data, because the users can adapte or refine well-performed learnwares rather than building a model from scratch by themselves.",
    ContinualLearning: "Continual learning",
    ContinualLearningDescription:
      "The learnware market naturally realizes continual and lifelong learning, because with the constant submissions of well-performed learnwares trained from diverse tasks, the knowledge held in the learnware market is being continually enriched.",
    CatastrophicForgetting: "Catastrophic forgetting",
    CatastrophicForgettingDescription:
      "A learnware will always be accommodated in the learnware market once it is accepted, unless every aspect of its function can be replaced by other learnwares. Thus, the old knowledge in the learnware market is always held. Nothing to be forgotten.",
    DataPrivacyProprietary: "Data privacy/proprietary",
    DataPrivacyProprietaryDescription:
      "The developers only submit their models without sharing their own data, and thus, the data privacy/proprietary can be well preserved. Although one could not deny the possibility of reverse engineering the models, the risk would be too small compared with many other privacy-preserving solutions.",
  },
  How: {
    Title: "How does learnware work?",
    Description:
      "There are three important entities: developers, users, and the market. The developers are usually machine learning experts who produce and want to share/sell their well-performed trained machine learning models. The users need machine learning services but usually have only limited data and lack machine learning knowledge and skills. The learnware market accepts/buys well-performed trained models from developers, accommodates them in the market, and provides/sells services to users via identifying and reusing learnwares to help users tackle their present tasks.",
  },
  SpecificationWorld: {
    Title: "Specification world",
    Description:
      "Note that the specification islands, corresponding to models from different feature/label spaces, can be merged if their connections are discovered and established.",
