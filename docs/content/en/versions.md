# Version Announcement

## Beimingwu v1.0 Version (2023.12)


The Beimingwu learnware Dock System v1.0 version is the first system-level implementation of the learnware paradigm, aimed at helping users effectively search and reuse learnware without building machine learning models from scratch.

### System Features

1. **Learnware Specification Generation**: The Beimingwu system provides a specification generation tool in the `learnware` Python package, supporting multiple data types (tables, images, and text), and can be efficiently generated locally.
2. **Learnware Quality Detection**: The Beimingwu system has multiple detection mechanisms to ensure the quality of each learnware in the system.
3. **Diverse Learnware Search**: The Beimingwu system supports both semantic specification and statistic specification searches, covering data types including tables, images, and text. Additionally, for tabular tasks, the system also supports the search of heterogeneous table learnware.
4. **Local Learnware Deployment**: The Beimingwu system also provides tools for learnware deployment and reuse in the `learnware` Python package, helping users to deploy and reuse learnware conveniently and securely.
5. **Data Privacy Protection**: The Beimingwu system's learnware upload, search, and deployment do not require users to upload local data, and all involved statistic specifications are generated locally by users, ensuring data privacy.
6. **Fully Open Source System**: All source code of the Beimingwu system, including the `learnware` Python package and front-end and back-end codes, are completely open source.
