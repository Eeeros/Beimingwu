The R&D (Research and Development) Team of Beimingwu is from [Nanjing University's LAMDA Research Institute](https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/MainPage.ashx), with Prof. [Zhi-Hua Zhou](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh) serving as the Founding Director.

LAMDA is affiliated with the National Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, the Department of Computer Science & Technology and the School of Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing University, China. It locates at Computer Science and Technology Building in the Xianlin campus of Nanjing University, mainly in Rm910.

"LAMDA" means "Learning And Mining from DatA". The main research interests of LAMDA include machine learning, data mining, pattern recognition, information retrieval, evolutionary computation, neural computation, and some other related areas. Currently our research mainly involves: ensemble learning, semi-supervised and active learning, multi-instance and multi-label learning, cost-sensitive and class-imbalance learning, metric learning, dimensionality reduction and feature selection, structure learning and clustering, theoretical foundations of evolutionary computation, improving comprehensibility, content-based image retrieval, web search and mining, face recognition, computer-aided medical diagnosis, bioinformatics, etc.

The Beimingwu system is currently maintained by the LAMDA Beimingwu R&D Team, consisting of: <a href="http://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;" target="_blank">Zhi-Hua Zhou</a>, <a href="http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/yuy" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;" target="_blank">Yang Yu</a>, <a href="http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/tanzh/" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;" target="_blank">Zhi-Hao Tan</a>, <a href="http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/liujd/" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;" target="_blank">Jian-Dong Liu</a>, <a href="http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/tanp/" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;" target="_blank">Peng Tan</a>, <a href="http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/bixd/" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;" target="_blank">Xiao-Dong Bi</a>, <a href="http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/zhengqc/" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;" target="_blank">Qin-Cheng Zheng</a>, Xiao-Chuan Zou, <a href="http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/xiey/" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;" target="_blank">Yi Xie</a>, Hai-Tian Liu, Hao-Yu Shi, Xin-Yu Zhang and others.
