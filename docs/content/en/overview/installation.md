# Environment Installation

In order to enable users to interact with the Beimingwu system easily and efficiently, we provide a series of simple and user-friendly interfaces in the `learnware` Python package. With just a few lines of code, everyone can implement functions such as "learnware specification generation," "learnware submission," "learnware search," and "learnware deployment".

The `learnware` package is currently avabilable on the [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/learnware/), and its specific installation method is as follows:
```bash
pip install learnware
```

The source code for the `learnware` package is also available on both [Gitee](https://gitee.com/Learnware-LAMDA/Learnware) and [Github](https://github.com/Learnware-LAMDA/Learnware) platforms. Users can download the source code from either platform for installation. Here is an example when using the Github platform:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Learnware-LAMDA/Learnware.git
cd Learnware
git fetch origin main
git checkout main
pip install -e .
```
