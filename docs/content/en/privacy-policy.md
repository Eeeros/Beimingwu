## 1. How We Collect and Use Your Information

When you use our services, we need/may need to collect and use your personal information, including the following two types:

1. To achieve the basic functions of providing services to you, you must authorize us to collect and use necessary information. If you refuse to provide the corresponding information, you will not be able to use our services normally;

2. To achieve additional functions of providing services to you, you can choose to authorize us to collect and use information. If you refuse to provide it, you may not be able to use the relevant additional functions or achieve the intended functional effects, but it will not affect your normal use of our basic functions.

The information we collect from you will be used for the following purposes:

1. Conducting data statistics to understand operational conditions;
2. Analyzing users' usage patterns and habits on the website to improve our services;
3. Preventing illegal or potential illegal activities, and preventing violations of website user norms;
4. Other purposes disclosed to you when collecting specific information.

We will provide you with specific functional scenarios, including:

### (1) Account Management

When you browse the platform website (whether or not you are registered or logged in), we may automatically collect the following information related to you: your browser type and language, operating system type, and broadband type; your IP address, which can sometimes indicate your geographical location; pages, advertisements, and links you have browsed on the website; user behavior logs; and the access requests you make when visiting the website, along with their dates, times, and referral URLs.

To ensure that we are providing services to you personally, we may verify your identity based on the information you provide.

### (2) Customer Service and Dispute Resolution

When you contact us or submit after-sales, dispute resolution applications, we need you to provide necessary personal information to verify your user identity for the security of your account and system.

For the convenience of contacting you, assisting you in solving problems promptly, or recording the handling solutions and results of related issues, we may save your communications, communication/call records, and related content (including account information, other information you provide to prove relevant facts, or contact information you leave). If you consult, complain, or provide suggestions regarding specific issues, we will use your account information.

For the reasonable needs of providing services and improving service quality, we may also use other information from you, including information you provide when contacting customer service and questionnaire reply information you send to us.

### (3) Other Rules for Collecting and Using Personal Information

If the information you provide contains personal information of other users, you must ensure that you have obtained legal authorization before providing this personal information to the platform.

If we indirectly obtain your information from third parties, we will explicitly request the third party in writing to clarify the source of the personal information and whether they have obtained your legal authorization for collecting, processing, and providing your personal information before collecting. Except in cases expressly permitted by law, we will only collect your personal information from third parties after confirming that the third party has obtained your authorized consent. If the third party's authorization scope cannot cover our processing and use purposes, we will protect your personal information obtained indirectly by our professional security team through measures such as security reinforcement (including sensitive information reporting, sensitive information encryption storage, access control, etc.). We will use protection measures and methods for indirectly obtained personal information that are not lower than those for our own user personal information.

## 3. How We Store and Protect Your Personal Information Security

### (1) Basic Rules for Data Storage

We will take reasonable and feasible measures to avoid collecting irrelevant user information.

### (2) Technical Measures for Data Protection

We strive to adopt various reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial security measures to protect your user information. This is done to prevent unauthorized access, public disclosure, use, modification, damage, or loss of user information. For example, we provide secure browsing through the HTTPS protocol on the platform website; we use encryption technology to enhance the security of user information; we employ trusted protection mechanisms to prevent malicious attacks on user information; and we implement access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized personnel can access user information; we generate the statistical specification of learnware in a privacy-preserving way. The Beimingwu system operations, including learnware upload, search, and deployment, do not require users to upload local data. All relevant statistical specifications are generated locally by users, ensuring data privacy.

### (3) Organizational Measures for Data Protection Management

We have established an advanced data security management system centered around data and covering various dimensions such as organizational development, system design, personnel management, and product technology. We have a dedicated department for personal information protection and conduct security and privacy protection training courses to enhance employees' awareness of the importance of protecting personal information.

In the event of an unfortunate user information security incident (such as leakage or loss), we will, in accordance with legal requirements, promptly inform you of the basic situation and possible impact of the security incident, the measures we have taken or will take, suggestions for you to independently prevent and reduce risks, and remedial measures for you. We will notify you of the event-related information via email, letters, phone calls, push notifications, etc. If it is difficult to inform individual data subjects one by one, we will announce the information in a reasonable and effective manner. Additionally, we will report the handling of user information security incidents to regulatory authorities as required.
